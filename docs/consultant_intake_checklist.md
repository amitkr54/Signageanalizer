# Consultant's Intake Checklist: The "Expert Consultation" 📋🤝

To provide a professional, legally defensible, and accurate signage recommendation, I need the following **"Input Package"** from any customer. This is what transforms a simple picture into a professional audit.

## 1. The High-Resolution "Map" (Mandatory)
- **Format**: Vector PDF or High-Res JPG (Min 300 DPI). 
- **Requirement**: Must be a clean architectural floor plan, not a hand-drawn sketch.
- **Why**: The AI needs to see standard CAD lines to identify "Structural DNA" (doors/stairs/walls).

## 2. Building Classification (Occupancy Type)
I need the customer to select from one of these categories:
- **Assembly** (Malls, Theaters, Airports)
- **Educational** (Schools, Colleges)
- **Institutional** (Hospitals, Clinics, Hotels)
- **Industrial** (Factories, Warehouses)
- **Business/Office** (Corporate Offices)
- **Why**: Fire codes (like NBC Part 4) have strictly different distances for an "Office" (30m travel) vs. a "Hospital" (15m travel).

## 3. Spatial Scale (The "Math" Key)
I need to know the real-world distance. This can be provided in two ways:
- **Method A**: A visible **Scale Bar** on the drawing.
- **Method B**: One "Reference Dimension" (e.g., "The width of the main corridor is 2.5 meters").
- **Why**: Without scale, I can detect an "Exit Sign" but I cannot tell if the next one is too far away.

## 4. Safety Architecture Context
- **Hazards**: Are there specific "High Risk" zones (Server Rooms, DB Rooms, Gas Banks)?
- **Existing Equipment**: Does the building already have a Fire NOC? (This helps verify if we are auditing an *existing* setup or a *new* one).

## 5. Regulatory Preference
- **Standard**: NBC (India), NFPA (International), or local State Fire Bylaws.
- **Why**: To ensure the "Reasons" in the report footer are correct for the local fire officer.

### 🚀 Summary for the Customer:
*"Please provide your **High-Res Floor Plan**, the **Building Type**, and the **Drawing Scale**. My AI will then analyze the egress paths and hazards to generate a complete compliance report based on the National Building Code."*
